# RAG Chat Application Flow

This document outlines the step-by-step flow of the RAG chat application.

## Step 1: Load Chat Sessions

**Request:**
```
GET /api/v1/chat/sessions?page=1&page_size=20
```

**API Response Example:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": 28,
    "title": "How are lost profits calculated in business disputes?",
    "created_at": "2025-08-31T20:15:48.812566",
    "updated_at": null
  },
  {
    "id": 27,
    "title": "What is Rebecca Martinez's settlement demand?",
    "created_at": "2025-08-31T20:17:28.193157",
    "updated_at": null
  }
]
```

**Purpose:** Populate the sidebar with existing chat sessions. Shows minimal session metadata needed for UI display with pagination support.

## Step 2: Load Chat Messages for Selected Session

**Request:**
```
GET /api/v1/chat/sessions/28/messages
```

**Alternative: Send New Message (POST)**
```
POST /api/v1/chat/sessions/28/messages
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "session_id": 28,
  "content": "What are the key points in Rebecca Martinez's case?"
}
```

**API Response Example:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": 145,
    "session_id": 28,
    "role": "user",
    "content": "How are lost profits calculated in business disputes?",
    "sources": null,
    "created_at": "2025-08-31T20:15:48.825134"
  },
  {
    "id": 146,
    "session_id": 28,
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Lost profits in business disputes are typically calculated using several methodologies:\n\n1. **Before-and-After Method**: Compares actual performance to historical performance before the alleged harm.\n\n2. **Yardstick Method**: Uses comparable businesses or market benchmarks as a baseline for expected performance.\n\n3. **But-For Analysis**: Determines what would have happened 'but for' the defendant's actions.\n\nKey factors considered include:\n- Historical financial performance\n- Market conditions and trends\n- Causation between the alleged harm and losses\n- Mitigation efforts by the plaintiff\n\nExperts often discount future profits to present value and must demonstrate reasonable certainty in their calculations.",
    "sources": [
      {
        "filename": "client_002_david_kim.pdf",
        "page": 0,
        "content": "break violations (Labor Code 226.7), inaccurate wage statements (Labor Code 226). DAMAGES: 18\nmonths unpaid overtime estimated at $45,000, meal/rest break premiums $8,400, waiting time\npenalties, attorney's fees. PAGA penalties potentially available.\nCASE TIMELINE\n Initial incident/violation occurr..."
      },
      {
        "filename": "client_005_sarah_chen.pdf",
        "page": 0,
        "content": "CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED\nCLIENT FILE: SARAH CHEN\nClient ID:\nLAW-005\nFull Name:\nSarah Chen\nPhone:\n(619) 555-0567\nEmail:\nsarah.chen.cto@email.com\nAddress:\n1647 Sunset Boulevard, San Diego, CA 92103\nEmployer/Defendant:\nFormer employer: InnovateTech Systems\nCase Type:\nTrade Secret Misappr..."
      },
      {
        "filename": "legal_reference.pdf",
        "page": 5,
        "content": "legal basis for processing  DATA MINIMIZATION: Collect only necessary information  CONSENT:\nMust be freely given, specific, informed  BREACH NOTIFICATION: Must notify within 72 hours  DATA\nSUBJECT RIGHTS: Access, rectification, erasure, portability Maximum fines: 4% of annual revenue or\nâ‚¬20 mill..."
      }
    ],
    "created_at": "2025-08-31T20:15:52.441298"
  }
]
```

**Purpose:** 
- **GET**: Load the full conversation history when user selects a specific chat session
- **POST**: Send a new message and get AI response via RAG pipeline

**Note:** Both GET and POST methods return the same message structure. The POST method returns the newly created AI response message after processing through the RAG pipeline (ChromaDB â†’ Ollama â†’ response with sources).

## Step 3: Health Check Monitoring

**Request:**
```
GET /api/v1/health
```

**API Response Example:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "services": {
    "ollama": "healthy",
    "chromadb": "healthy"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-08-31T23:45:12.123456"
}
```

**Purpose:** Monitors all critical services (Ollama LLM, ChromaDB vector database) to ensure the RAG pipeline is functional. Frontend automatically checks every 30 seconds and displays system status in the top bar.

**Status Types:**
- `healthy`: All services operational
- `degraded`: Some services down, limited functionality
- `unhealthy`: Critical services unavailable

**Behind the Scenes:**
- Ollama check: `GET {ollama_url}/api/tags` (5s timeout)
- ChromaDB check: `GET {chroma_url}/api/v1/heartbeat` (5s timeout)
- Visual indicator: Color-coded dot in UI (ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´âš«)

## Step 4: View Document File

**Request:**
```
GET /api/v1/documents/view/client_005_sarah_chen.pdf
```

**API Response:**
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/pdf
Content-Disposition: inline; filename="client_005_sarah_chen.pdf"
Cache-Control: private, max-age=3600
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' http://localhost:3000

[Binary PDF file content]
```

**Purpose:** Serves the actual uploaded document file for viewing in browser. Users can click on source references in chat responses to view the original document.

**Security Features:**
- Filename validation (alphanumeric, dots, dashes, underscores only)
- File type restriction (PDF/TXT only)
- Same-origin iframe protection
- Private caching (1 hour)

**Usage:** 
- Embedded in `<iframe>` for inline viewing
- Opened in new tab/window
- Referenced from chat message sources

## Database Architecture: ORM Explanation

### What is SQLAlchemy (Our ORM)?

**ORM = Object-Relational Mapping** - Yes, it's like a **framework for databases** that converts Python objects into SQL operations.

**Without ORM (Raw SQL):**
```python
# Hard to write, error-prone
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM chat_sessions WHERE user_id = ?", (user_id,))
rows = cursor.fetchall()
```

**With ORM (SQLAlchemy):**
```python
# Clean, readable Python code
sessions = db.query(ChatSession).filter(ChatSession.user_id == user_id).all()
```

### Key Benefits in Our App

1. **No SQL needed** - Write Python instead of SQL queries
2. **Type safety** - IDE knows what fields exist (`session.title`, `session.id`)
3. **Database agnostic** - Same code works with PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL
4. **Automatic mapping** - Python objects â†” Database tables

### Our Models (`/backend/app/core/database.py`)

- `ChatSession` Python class = `chat_sessions` PostgreSQL table
- `ChatMessage` Python class = `chat_messages` PostgreSQL table

**Example from our codebase:**
```python
# Create session (becomes INSERT INTO chat_sessions...)
session = ChatSession(title="New Chat")
db.add(session)
db.commit()

# Query sessions (becomes SELECT * FROM chat_sessions ORDER BY...)
sessions = db.query(ChatSession).order_by(ChatSession.created_at.desc()).all()
```

**Bottom line:** ORM = Database framework that lets you write Python objects instead of SQL strings.
